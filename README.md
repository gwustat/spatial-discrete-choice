# spatial-discrete-choice
Code for my paper with Haoying Wang. The paper is titled by ``Modeling Discrete Choice with Large Fine-Scale Spatial Data: Opportunities and Challenges".

To run the included R code, one needs to compile two C files first by
R CMD SHLIB compute_trWpowers.c
R CMD SHLIB mvtnormQmat.c
